# F.ORM

The Salesforce ORM. Documentation still very much a work in progress. Not a ton of code yet though so should be pretty easy to follow.

# Usage

Still pretty early but take a look at `SimpleSOQLQuery` and `SimpleSOSLQuery` classes.

Also take a look at `tests/SimpleSOQLQueryTests.cls` and `tests/SimpleSOSLQueryTests.cls` for some usage examples.
